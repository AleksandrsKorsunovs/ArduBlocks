This repository is created for developing Ardublock project.
Main goal is to create Ardublock extension, which allows to 
programm a SumoBoy robot with specially created custom blocks.

Project consists of two main parts:

- Modified ArduBlock tool for arduino IDE which allows Programming 
Arduino like boards using Blocks.
- ArduinoSumoBoy library for arduino which siplifies arduino code.

To start using ArduBlock extension open Arduino folder which most probably
is located somwhere like: C:\Users\"UserName"\Documents\Arduino

1) copy ArduBlockTool folder to \Arduino\tools folder
2) copy SumoBoyLibrary folder to \Arduino\libraries folder

In folder Raw is located Ardublock and Openblock code, which can bo modified
to extend already existing functionaity.
